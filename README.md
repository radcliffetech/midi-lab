A collection of MIDI tools written in Go and Node.js for converting, transforming, and generating MIDI data.

Includes converters, servers, visualizers, and more.

## 📁 Structure

- `go/` — CLI tools and libraries for MIDI manipulation (compiled and fast)
- `node/` — APIs and live MIDI tools (great for real-time and browser work)
- `python/` - Python tools for counterpoint generation
- `examples/` — Example MIDI files and usage walkthroughs
- `docs/` — Architecture and design notes

## 🚀 Goals

- Showcase polyglot coding (Go + Node.js + Python)
- Highlight MIDI processing expertise
- Offer useful open-source tools for musicians and developers
