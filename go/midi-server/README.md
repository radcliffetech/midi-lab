# MIDI Server

This Go application listens to a local MIDI input device and broadcasts MIDI NoteOn messages over a WebSocket server.  
Clients (like web browsers) can connect and receive live MIDI data in real time.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Go 1.20+
- PortMIDI C library installed on your system

### Install PortMIDI

**On macOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install portmidi
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install libportmidi-dev
```

(Windows setup requires manual PortMIDI installation.)

## âš¡ Setup and Run

Clone or download this project. Then:

```bash
# Inside the midi-server directory:
go mod tidy

# Run the server
go run main.go
```

The server will start:
- WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:8080/ws`
- Static file server: `http://localhost:8080`

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` to view the live MIDI data stream.
